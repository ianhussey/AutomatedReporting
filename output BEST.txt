Bayesian BEST tests (Kruschke, 2013) were used to compare differences between the flowers condition and the insects condition. In each case, the model employed 5 parameters to describe the data: the means of both conditions (μ1, μ2), the standard deviations of both conditions (σ1, σ2), and a shared normality parameter (ν). We employed the default BEST prior, which is a noncommittal prior intended to have minimal impact on the posterior distribution. Specifically, for sample yi in (y1, y2), μi = normal(M = mean(yi), SD = sd(yi)*5)), σi = gamma(Mo = sd(yi), SD = sd(yi)*5), ν = gamma(M = 30, SD = 30). See Kruschke (2013) for details of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method. Finally, in order to allow us to assess group equality as well as group differences, a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) was defined (negligible effect size: -0.2 < d < 0.2). 

The posterior probabilities of a BEST test with IAT D1 change scores as DV and condition as IV indicated that 99.91% of credible effect sizes were greater than 0, and 1.51% were within the ROPE. The most credible effect size was of medium size with a highest density interval that overlapped zero, Mode d = 0.67, 95% HDI [0.25, 1.15]. We therefore concluded that IAT D1 change scores between the flowers condition (M = 0.11) and the insects condition (M = -0.11) were neither credibly different nor credibly equal. No firm conclusions could therefore be drawn.
