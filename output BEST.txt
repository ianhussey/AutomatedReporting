A Bayesian BEST test (Kruschke, 2013) was used to compare differences in IAT D1 change scores between the flowers condition and the insects condition. The model employed 5 parameters to describe the data: the means of both conditions (μ1, μ2), the standard deviations of both conditions (σ1, σ2), and a shared normality parameter (ν). We employed the default BEST prior, which is a noncommittal prior intended to have minimal impact on the posterior distribution. Specifically, for sample yi in (y1, y2), μi = normal(M = mean(yi), SD = sd(yi)*5)), σi = gamma(Mo = sd(yi), SD = sd(yi)*5), ν = gamma(M = 30, SD = 30). In order to allow us to assess group equality as well as group differences, a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) was defined (negligible effect size: -0.2 < d < 0.2). The posterior probabilities indicated that 99.89% of credible effect sizes were greater than 0, and 1.53% were within the ROPE. The most credible effect size was of medium size with a highest density interval that did not overlap zero, Mode d = 0.67, 95% HDI [0.23, 1.14]. We therefore concluded that IAT D1 change scores between the flowers condition (M = 0.11) and the insects condition (M = -0.11) were credbily different.
