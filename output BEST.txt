Bayesian analysis (Kruschke, 2013) was used to compare differences in IAT D1 scores between the flowers condition and the insects condition. The analysis accommodated the possibility of outliers by using t distributions to describe the data, and allowed for different variances across the groups. Specifically, the model employed 5 parameters to describe the data: the means of both conditions (μ1, μ2), the standard deviations of both conditions (σ1, σ2), and a shared normality parameter (ν). We employed the default prior, which is a noncommittal prior intended to have minimal impact on the posterior distribution. Specifically, for sample yi in (y1, y2), μi = normal(M = mean(yi), SD = sd(yi)*5)), σi = gamma(Mo = sd(yi), SD = sd(yi)*5), ν = gamma(M = 30, SD = 30). The posterior distribution was represented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods (see Kruschke, 2013). For decision-making purposes, a region of practical equivalence (ROPE: Kruschke, 2011) for negligible effect size was defined (-0.2 < d < 0.2; Cohen, 1988). 

The MCMC chains converged well and had an effective sample size (ESS) greater than 10,000 for all parameters. The posterior distributions showed the modal estimate of the IAT D1 scores was 0.11 for the flowers condition and -0.11 for the insects condition. The modal estimated effect size was medium (Cohen, 1988) with a 95% Highest Density Interval that did not include zero, Mo d = 0.66, 95% HDI [0.24, 1.14]. 1.5 % of estimated effect sizes fell within the ROPE. Given that less than 95% of estimated effect sizes fell within the ROPE and the 95% RDI did not include zero, the posterior distribution therefore indicated that credible differences existed between the groups.
