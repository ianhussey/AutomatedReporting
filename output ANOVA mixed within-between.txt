A mixed within-between ANOVA was conducted with the outcome variable as DV, condition as the between subjects IV, and time point as the within subjects IV. No main effect was found for condition, F(1, 98) = 0.00, p = .995, ng2 < .01. No main effect was found for time point, F(1, 98) = 0.00, p = .986, ng2 < .01. A significant condition*time point interaction effect was found, F(1, 98) = 9.43, p = .003, ng2 = .04.
