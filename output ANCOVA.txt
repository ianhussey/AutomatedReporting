An ANCOVA was conducted with time point 2 as the DV, condition as the IV, and time point 1 as a covariate. A main effect for condition was found: after controlling for time point 1 scores, scores at time point 2 were significantly different between condition A (n = 52, adjusted M = -0.01, SD = 0.25) and condition B (n = 48, adjusted M = -0.13, SD = 0.25), F(1, 97) = 6.18, p = .01, Î·2 = 0.06, 90% CI [0.01, 0.15].
