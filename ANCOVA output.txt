An ANCOVA was conducted with scores at timepoint 2 as the DV, experimental condition as the IV, and scores at timepoint 1 entered as a covariate. A main effect for condition was found: after controlling for scores at timepoint 1, scores at timepoint 2 were significantly different between condition A (n = 52, adjusted M = -0.01, SD = 0.25) and condition B (n = 48, adjusted M = -0.13, SD = 0.25), F(1, 97) = 4.22, p = .04, Î·2 = 0.04, 90% CI [0, 0.12].
